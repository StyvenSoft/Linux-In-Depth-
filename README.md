# Linux Essentials Practice Exercises

This repository contains practice exercises in Shell scripting (`sh`) based on the *Linux Essentials* material. These exercises are part of a "Diplomado de Profundización en Administración de Sistemas Operativos Open Source con Certificación en Linux" (Specialization Diploma in Open Source Operating System Administration with Linux Certification) that I am currently undertaking. This program offers students of the Systems Engineering program a unique opportunity to develop specialized skills and obtain a recognized international certification.

## About the Material

The exercises in this repository are based on the *Linux Essentials* learning material, version 1.6, provided by the Linux Professional Institute (LPI). The material is available at the following link: [Linux Essentials Learning Material](https://learning.lpi.org/es/learning-materials/010-160/).

### Description

The *Linux Essentials* certification is a great way to demonstrate to employers that you have the fundamental skills required for your next job or promotion. It also serves as an ideal stepping stone for the more advanced LPIC (Linux Professional Institute Certification) path for Linux System Administrators.

## About LPI

4. **Topic 4: The Linux Operating System**
5. **Topic 5: Security and File Permissions**
